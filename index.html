            <h3>Full Stack Developer</h3>
            <p>I have been working in the medical field for over 15 years. In my early career I began working on the ambulance as an EMT then progressed to a paramedic. 
                I then advanced my career into the management side of EMS. Functioning as the FTO/Field medic for a local ambulance company, I would conduct paramedic refresher training, CPR and ACLS classes. I began working in the remote medical world in 2010. I became the EMS supervisor for a large safety company where I managed day to day operations, inventory supply chain, medical record audits, payroll and staffing duties. Later I had the opportunity to work within a small and rapidly growing company on the cutting edge of technology, I have held a few different positions which have honed my management skills in many different areas. Operations, Human Resources, Business Development and Procurement/Logistics are a some of the divisions within the company I have been actively involved in. 
                As for myself I am a very easy going person who works well almost anyone. Motivation to succeed is a major driving factor for me. In my leisure I enjoy fishing, skiing and kayaking. </p>
